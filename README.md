# Olmec Low Stock Notification Plugin

The Olmec Low Stock Notification Plugin is a WordPress plugin that notifies store managers when the stock levels of products in a specific category fall below a defined threshold. This helps in ensuring that store managers can take timely action to replenish the stock and avoid out-of-stock situations.

## Features

- Adds a settings tab in WooCommerce for configuring low stock notifications.
- Allows enabling/disabling email notifications for low stock alerts.
- Displays a metabox on the WordPress dashboard with stock information.
- Automatically processes notifications for low stock levels and logs actions.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin and unzip it.
2. Upload the `olmec-low-stock` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Configure the plugin settings under WooCommerce > Settings > Low stock by category.

## Settings

The plugin provides several settings to customize its behavior:

- **Show metabox on dashboard**: Display a metabox on the WordPress dashboard showing stock levels by category.
- **Send email notification to store manager**: Enable or disable email notifications when stock levels are low.

## Usage

### Adding a Settings Tab

The plugin adds a custom settings tab in WooCommerce for managing low stock notifications.

```php
public function addSettingsTab($settingsTab)
{
    $settingsTab['olmec_lowstock_options'] = __('Low stock by category', OLMEC_LOW_STOCK_TEXT_DOMAIN);
    return $settingsTab;
}
```
## Tests
### Running tests
Unit tests are provided for the plugin using Mockery and PestPHP. To run the tests, use the following commands:

```sh
composer install
composer run tests
```

## Code patterns
Always try to encapsulate and separate concerns. If a piece of code displays markup, move it to a template file and render it using the available tools. Keep casing consistent with PSR directives. Hooks are how we load our app inside WordPress, acting as an API we interact with. Therefore, we leverage hooks in a loader class, which is responsible for booting our app. Side effects (such as sending an email) should be queued and processed in a non-blocking way. Not following this pattern can lead to severe consequences during periods of heavy load. Indexation is better than nesting loops. Always find a way to pull data and store it in an indexed manner. For instance, we do not need to collect all categories and then loop through all products. This should be done only once, when the plugin is activated. After that, we leverage hooks to manipulate a simple array that we can query by index.
